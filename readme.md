## Setup a react project
-  npx create-react-app app-name    / npm create vite@latest
    - npm run start  -> runs project in developmet environment
    - npm run build  -> build project for production

- In project : 
    - public/ -> index.html(entry point to project) and files/images publically available
    - src/ -> folder where we'll work index.js creates a root of Reactdom and renders App.js
                App.js is base of our whole application
    - package.json -> consists dependencies, start scripts and more
    - package-lock.json -> consits dep. of depend and their version
    
- In react app using vite :
    - npm i -> to create node_modules
    - public/ -> public files/images
    - src/ -> App.jsx and main.jsx similar to create-react-app ones
    - npm run dev -> run project in dev environment
